# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
The Weather-Dashboard project uses the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities. When a user searches a city, the application will return the current weather and a five-day forecast.

Users will be able to view the following weather conditions:
* temperature
* wind
* humidity

This application also features a sidebar that displays the user's previous searches so they can easily view the forecast again.


## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
